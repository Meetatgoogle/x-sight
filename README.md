# The Sight application tracing and control tool 


Sight makes it easy to log the dynamic behavior of software systems and 
connect it to the source code that generated them. The core capabilities of Sight are:
* High level representation of dynamic application behavior, including state, 
  functionality and performance.
* Capability to scalably analyze logs of these behaviors using external storage 
  (e.g. Google Cloud Storage avro files) and query (e.g. BigQuery) systems.
* GUI that makes it easy for users to understand and query logs to gain key
  insights about application behavior.
* Facility for the application to ask external tools (e.g. optimizers or ML
  models) to direct its execution to achieve user-defined objectives.
